* is inert off-provider. Within the supported lane, the behavior matrix is:
*
* - Supported provider/model + explicit `"strict-agentic"` in config
*   (defaults or per-agent override) ⇒ `"strict-agentic"`.
* - Supported provider/model + explicit `"default"` in config ⇒ `"default"`
*   (opt-out honored).
* - Supported provider/model + unspecified ⇒ `"strict-agentic"` so the

*   without requiring every user to set the flag.
* - Unsupported provider/model (anything that is not openai or openai-codex
*   with a gpt-5-family model id) ⇒ `"default"`, even when the config
*   explicitly sets `"strict-agentic"`. The retry guard and blocked-exit
*   helpers all check this lane again, so an explicit `"strict-agentic"`
*   on an unsupported lane is a no-op rather than a hard failure.
*
* This means explicit opt-out still works, but the gate criterion
* "GPT-5.4 no longer stalls after planning" now covers unconfigured
* installations, not only users who opted in manually.

		description: `Manage Gateway cron jobs (status/list/add/update/remove/run/runs) and send wake events. Use this for reminders, "check back later" requests, delayed follow-ups, and recurring tasks. Do not emulate scheduling with exec sleep or process polling.

Main-session cron jobs enqueue system events for heartbeat handling. Isolated cron jobs create background task runs that appear in \`openclaw tasks\`.

ACTIONS:
- status: Check cron scheduler status
- list: List jobs (use includeDisabled:true to include disabled)
- add: Create job (requires job object, see schema below)
- update: Modify job (requires jobId + patch object)
- remove: Delete job (requires jobId)
- run: Trigger job immediately (requires jobId)
- runs: Get job run history (requires jobId)
- wake: Send wake event (requires text, optional mode)

JOB SCHEMA (for add action):
{
  "name": "string (optional)",
  "schedule": { ... },      // Required: when to run
  "payload": { ... },       // Required: what to execute
  "delivery": { ... },      // Optional: announce summary (isolated/current/session:xxx only) or webhook POST
  "sessionTarget": "main" | "isolated" | "current" | "session:<custom-id>",  // Optional, defaults based on context
  "enabled": true | false   // Optional, default true
}

SESSION TARGET OPTIONS:
- "main": Run in the main session (requires payload.kind="systemEvent")
- "isolated": Run in an ephemeral isolated session (requires payload.kind="agentTurn")
- "current": Bind to the current session where the cron is created (resolved at creation time)
- "session:<custom-id>": Run in a persistent named session (e.g., "session:project-alpha-daily")

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR (unchanged for backward compatibility):
- payload.kind="systemEvent" → defaults to "main"
- payload.kind="agentTurn" → defaults to "isolated"
To use current session binding, explicitly set sessionTarget="current".

SCHEDULE TYPES (schedule.kind):
- "at": One-shot at absolute time
  { "kind": "at", "at": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>" }
- "every": Recurring interval
  { "kind": "every", "everyMs": <interval-ms>, "anchorMs": <optional-start-ms> }
- "cron": Cron expression
  { "kind": "cron", "expr": "<cron-expression>", "tz": "<optional-timezone>" }

ISO timestamps without an explicit timezone are treated as UTC.

PAYLOAD TYPES (payload.kind):
- "systemEvent": Injects text as system event into session
  { "kind": "systemEvent", "text": "<message>" }
- "agentTurn": Runs agent with message (isolated sessions only)
  { "kind": "agentTurn", "message": "<prompt>", "model": "<optional>", "thinking": "<optional>", "timeoutSeconds": <optional, 0 means no timeout> }

DELIVERY (top-level):
  { "mode": "none|announce|webhook", "channel": "<optional>", "to": "<optional>", "bestEffort": <optional-bool> }
  - Default for isolated agentTurn jobs (when delivery omitted): "announce"
  - announce: send to chat channel (optional channel/to target)
  - webhook: send finished-run event as HTTP POST to delivery.to (URL required)
  - If the task needs to send to a specific chat/recipient, set announce delivery.channel/to; do not call messaging tools inside the run.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- sessionTarget="main" REQUIRES payload.kind="systemEvent"
- sessionTarget="isolated" | "current" | "session:xxx" REQUIRES payload.kind="agentTurn"
- For webhook callbacks, use delivery.mode="webhook" with delivery.to set to a URL.
Default: prefer isolated agentTurn jobs unless the user explicitly wants current-session binding.

WAKE MODES (for wake action):
- "next-heartbeat" (default): Wake on next heartbeat
- "now": Wake immediately

Use jobId as the canonical identifier; id is accepted for compatibility. Use contextMessages (0-10) to add previous messages as context to the job text.`,
